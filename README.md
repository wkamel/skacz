Skacz - Jump!
=============
One of my experiments with RaspberryPi.
---------------------------------------

This simple project utilises proximity sensor to control Hello Kitty on the screen.

Moving your hand up and down Kitty jumps up and down.

Just a bit less advanced technology than Xbox Kinect ;)
